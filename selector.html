        welcome to the implementations of selector

    </h1>

    <p>
        CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories: <br>

        <b>
            Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)  <br>
            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them) <br>
            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state) <br>
            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element) <br>
            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) 
        </b>
     
    </p>

    <article>
            The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

            An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site. <br>
            
            Potential sources for the <article> element: <br>
            
           <b>
            Forum post <br>
            Blog post <br>
            News story <br>
            Note:The <article> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <article> element <br>
           </b>

    </article>

        HTML is the markup language that helps you define the structure of a web page. CSS is the stylesheet language you use to make the structure presentable and nicely laid out.

        To make the stylings you implement with CSS reflect in the HTML, you have to find a way to link the CSS to the HTML.
        
        You can do the linking by writing inline CSS, internal CSS, or external CSS.
        
        It is a best practice to keep your CSS separate from your HTML, so this article focuses on how you can link that external CSS to your HTML.

        To link your CSS to your HTML, you have to use the link tag with some relevant attributes.

       The link tag is a self-closing tag you should put at the head section of your HTML.

      To link CSS to HTML with it, this is how you do it:

          <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" /> -->
    </p>

        <b style="color: crimson;">The rel Attribute</b>
        rel is the relationship between the external file and the current file. For CSS, you use stylesheet. For example, rel="stylesheet"<br>

      <b style="color: crimson;">The rel Attribute</b>
        type is the type of the document you are linking to the HTML. For CSS, it is text/css. For example type="text/css"<br>

       <b style="color: crimson;">The href Attribute</b>
       href stands for “hypertext reference”. You use it to specify the location of the CSS file and the file name. It is a clickable link, so you can also hold CTRL and click it to view the CSS file.

       For example, href="styles.css" if the CSS file is located in the same folder as the HTML file. Or href="folder/styles.css" if the CSS file is located on another folder.
